            <p>
                Defenders of Wildlife is a major national conservation organization dedicated to conserving wildlife, protecting wildlife habitat and safeguarding biodiversity. Founded in 1947, Defenders of Wildlife was originally called Defenders of Fur Bearers, with
                its primary mission to preserve wild animals. Although its mission has broadened to include wildlife habitat and biodiversity, protecting wild animals--especially large carnivores--remains a central part of its mission.

            <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Defenders' aim is to conserve the full range of vulnerable North American biodiversity, from plants and pollinators to predators. The organization operates from the premise that in order for diverse wildlife populations in North America to be secure and
                thriving, they must be sustained by a transnational network of healthy lands and waters, including public and private lands, rivers and coastal waters, core natural areas and working landscapes.
            </p>
            <p>
                These goals are sought through grassroots efforts at the state and local level; developing programs that protect and restore key species and habitats; working with state, national and international policy makers to secure laws and policies that protect
                animals and their habitats; and, by taking a leading role in establishing legal safeguards for native wildlife and fighting efforts in the courts to roll back environmental protections.
